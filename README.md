# Chatterpy
Simple, yet buggy, shared database internal chat.

Use a file in a shared location and start chatting with your colleagues.
Pure python, standalone, just run the script.

The chat is very weakly password encrypted, no level of safety or privacy is guaranteed.
Corruption of chat due to a number of reasons may occur.
Do not trust this program. Do not trust anyone.

Have fun!
